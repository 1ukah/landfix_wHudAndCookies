# landfix_wHudAndCookies
Modified Landfix plugin that saves players settings and has a toggleable HUD.   
Cherry's landfix has been deprecated as well and Haze's landfix will be used instead, as cherry's landfix is not really reliable and unnecessary.   
If you still want to have /landfixtype just remove the comments from the /landfixtype commands and it'll work.    

Code modified from: https://github.com/enimmy/not-broken-landfix    

## Commands    
/lf - Enable Landfix    
/lfhud - Enable Landfix Hud
