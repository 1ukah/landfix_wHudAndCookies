# landfix_wHudAndCookies
Modified Landfix plugin that saves players settings and has a toggleable HUD.   
Cherry's landfix has been deprecated as well, since it's not really reliable and unnecessary. Haze's landfix will be used instead.   
If you still want to have /landfixtype just remove the comments from the /landfixtype commands and it'll work.    

Code modified from: https://github.com/enimmy/not-broken-landfix    

## Commands    
/lf - Enable Landfix    
/lfhud - Enable Landfix Hud
